To overload The Assignment operator, the signature must be the following:

const Text & Text::operator= ( const Text &other )
{
}

You should also change it in the Text.h file.

Reason:
The overloaded assignment should be able to support assignment chaining like a=b=c;
If the method returns nothing the compiler complains about assignment chaining.
You want you custom class works like primitive type and since assignment chaining is supported by primitive types
Text class should support it too.
